# karthik_project — Share & upload instructions

This small web project contains static files (HTML, CSS, JS) and a simple Python `app.py`.

Quick ways to share this folder:

1) Create a ZIP (already created for you)

- ZIP path (created): `C:\Users\PUJITHA\OneDrive\Desktop\karthik_project.zip`

2) Create & push a GitHub repo (local commands; you need git + creds/PAT)

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\PUJITHA\OneDrive\Desktop\karthik_project'
# initialize repository
git init
# create a sensible .gitignore
echo "__pycache__/`n*.pyc`n.env`nvenv/`nnode_modules/" > .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
# create a remote repo on GitHub then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

3) Share via OneDrive

- Right-click the ZIP file or the `karthik_project` folder in OneDrive and choose "Share" to get a link.
- If you prefer a public download, upload the ZIP to GitHub Releases or a cloud storage that provides a direct-download link.

Small notes about this project (discoverable patterns):

- Static site: `index.html`, `faculty.html`, `student.html`, `style.css`, `script.js` are simple static pages.
- Backend: `app.py` likely serves or processes form data — inspect before exposing to the public.
- Requirements: `requirements.txt` lists Python dependencies (use a virtualenv).

If you want I can also:
- initialize a git repo here and push it to GitHub (you'll need to create the remote or provide credentials)
- add a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` tailored for AI agents

Tell me which of the above you'd like next.

Publish to GitHub Pages (static site)
-----------------------------------
If you want to publish this project as a static site on GitHub Pages (avoids ngrok):

1) Ensure you have a git repo and commit the project

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\PUJITHA\OneDrive\Desktop\karthik_project'
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare site for GitHub Pages"
# create a repo on GitHub, then add remote and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-user>/<repo>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

2) Publish the `docs/` folder from the repo (on GitHub)
- In your repo on github.com go to Settings → Pages → Build and deployment
- Choose "Deploy from a branch" and set the branch to `main` and folder to `/docs`
- Save; the site will be available at https://<your-user>.github.io/<repo>/ after a minute.

Why this avoids 404s
- GitHub Pages serves static files. Flask templates use server-side rendering (Jinja) so you must publish a static copy (the `docs/` folder contains copies of templates rendered to static HTML with correct `static/` paths).
