Voice Form Filler - README

Files:
- index.html
- script.js

How to use:
1. Put both files in the same folder.
2. Open index.html in Google Chrome (desktop) or Edge.
3. Click "Start Recording". Grant microphone permission when the browser asks.
4. Speak phrases like:
   - "Name is John Doe"
   - "Age is 28"
   - "Email is john at example dot com"
   - "City is Pune"
5. You can click "Auto-Fill From Transcript" to have the page parse the transcript and populate the inputs.
6. After values appear, click into your target form (or keep this page) to use/submit them.

Notes & Tips:
- Web Speech API requires an internet connection (it uses a remote speech service).
- Best browser: Chrome (desktop). Mobile support varies.
- If "Start Recording" doesn't work, open browser console (F12) and check errors.
- The parser is intentionally simple; adapt the regex in script.js to recognize more natural variations.
- For privacy: spoken audio is sent to the browser vendor's speech service (Google when using Chrome).
